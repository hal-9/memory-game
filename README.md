# memory-Game
**memory game project for the front-end web developer nanodegree at udacity**

## features: 
* upon the first click on a card a timer starts that keeps track of the time the player needs to finish the game
* every pair of cards opened counts as a move, which is displayed for the player
* depending on the amount of moves a star rating is shown (3 being highest, 0 being lowest)
* matching cards stay open and change color
* if all cards are matched the game ends and a modal appears
* the modal summarizes all player stats and gives the option to start a new game
